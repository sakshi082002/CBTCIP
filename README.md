1.WORD COUNT TOOL:designed to analyze a text file and count the number of words, lines, and characters. The program includes essential header files such as stdio.h for standard input-output operations and ctype.h for character classification functions. It defines a macro, MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH, to specify the maximum length of the filename. In the main() function, the program declares variables for the file pointer, filename, character being read, and counters for words, lines, and characters, along with flags to track word and line processing. The user is prompted to enter the filename, which is read using scanf(). The program attempts to open the file in read mode ("r"), and if unsuccessful, it prints an error message and exits. It then reads characters from the file until the end of the file is reached, incrementing the character counter and updating the line and word counters based on character type and whitespace detection. After processing, the file is closed, and final adjustments are made to the word and line counts if necessary. The program concludes by printing the total counts of words, lines, and characters, demonstrating fundamental file handling and character processing techniques in C.

2.EXPENSE TRACKER:This C application implements an Expense Tracker that enables users to record, display, and compute their expenses efficiently. It includes essential header files such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, and time.h. Constants like INITIAL_CAPACITY and MAX_CATEGORY_LENGTH are defined to manage the initial array capacity and category length. The core functionality is encapsulated in a structure named Expense, which tracks category, amount, and datetime of each expense. Global variables manage the expenses array, expense count, and capacity.
Key functions include addExpense for inputting new expenses with the current datetime and dynamically resizing the array if needed; displayExpenses for showing all recorded expenses along with their details; computeTotalExpenses for calculating the total expenditure; and displayTotalExpenses for presenting the total amount. The cleanup function handles memory deallocation for the expenses array.In the main function, a menu-driven interface allows users to select options for adding expenses, viewing records, displaying the total, or exiting. The system operates in a loop, continually prompting for user input and invoking the appropriate functions. Memory allocation for the expenses array is managed using malloc, and memory cleanup is performed before exiting. This Expense Tracker provides a straightforward yet effective tool for personal finance management.
